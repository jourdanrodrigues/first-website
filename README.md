# First project

This is the very first web application I created. I'm leaving it as I found it,
though many files are missing due to a cleanup I was performing. I only noticed
afterwards that I was deleting this project's files.

Originally, it'd play some music (Estranged from Guns n' Roses, Altitudes from
Jason Becker and others) and had a gradient starting and ending with blue, and
white in the middle.

## Running the project

It has a very simple NodeJS setup.

```sh
npm i
node server.js
```

After those commands, it should be running on http://localhost:3000/
